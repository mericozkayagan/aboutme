# About me 
I am Meriç Özkayagan, I am a Devops Engineer. My main interests are getting more known in the community and moving out of the country for a global network and better living conditions. I have been working for 2 years, starting as a Backend Engineer then changing into Devops. I am seeking help mostly for group project that may challenge us and keep us reaching further heights. I enjoy trying for the better and learning in the way. I think that learning is most successful like this way. I enjoy helping to other who just started to Devops or Web Development in general since there is so much to learn and a lot more to improvise. That can be overwhelming for beginners so I am willing to help who show interest. My main goal for the next 3 years is improving myself in multicloud environments, enterprise level scaling; getting AWS certificates and graduating from university. After that I can finally move to Netherlands as a Devops Engineer which is my final goal.
