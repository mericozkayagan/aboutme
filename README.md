# About me 
I am Meriç Özkayagan, I am a DevOps Engineer. My main interests are getting more known in the community and moving out of the country for a global network and better living conditions. I have been working for two years, starting as a Backend Engineer then changing into DevOps. I am seeking help mostly for group projects that may challenge us and keep us reaching further heights. I enjoy trying for the better and learning along the way. I think that learning is most successful in this way. I enjoy helping others who just started DevOps or Web Development in general since there is so much to learn and a lot more to improvise. That can be overwhelming for beginners, so I am willing to help those who show interest. My main goal for the next 3 years is to improve myself in multicloud environments, enterprise level scaling; getting AWS certificates, and graduating from university. After that, I can finally move to the Netherlands as a DevOps Engineer which is my final goal.
