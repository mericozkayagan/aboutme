In a world rapidly changing with technological advancements, the call for universal coding skills has become increasingly common. However, I respectfully disagree with this notion, asserting that computers do not inherently teach critical thinking. 

Firstly, saying that computers teach us how to think overlooks the fact that humans are the ones who create and program computers. Computers are just tools we use to process information. They don't have the same cognitive abilities as humans. 

Additionally, the rise of AI-driven code generators doesn't mean we can ignore the importance of understanding code. While these AI tools can help with some aspects of coding, they can't replace human understanding and problem-solving skills. In fact, the increasing use of AI highlights the need for human expertise in directing technological advancements. 

While coding is evolving rapidly, it's still crucial to understand the basics. Instead of relying solely on code generators, we should focus on gaining a deeper understanding of coding principles. By asking better questions and approaching coding with a critical mindset, we can adapt to changes in technology more effectively. 

In conclusion, while computers and AI technologies are important in our digital world, they don't teach critical thinking on their own. It's through human intellect and inquiry that we truly understand code and its applications. As aspiring computer engineers, let's remember the importance of critical thinking in navigating the complexities of our digital age.
